# ^ Use Boolean search on LinkedIn
# it prefilters results, making things faster and using less resources
# the boolean search doesn't filter out the promoted listings, even if they do include those NOT strings, therefore in the code I have another filter - for a good reason!
# their boolean search is spotty. Put too many phrases - no results. Put NOT ("lead" OR "senior") or NOT (lead OR senior) - widely different results by a magnitude of 4. Don't relay on it.

positions:
  - Python
  -  # Another position you want to search for

locations: # linkedin doesn't seem to support boolean searches (OR for example) for the location field, so they have to be separate searches
  - Remote
  - Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom
  -  # A second location you want to search in

# --------- Optional Parameters -------
# output_filename:
# - # PATH TO OUTPUT FILE (default output.csv)

# Company names you want to ignore
blacklist:
# Add job titles you want to ignore
